# instead of repeating these for each instance,
#   use the "defaults" section instead, and override when needed
#   in the instance section
# note that instances get a default hostname that follows the pattern
#   {cluster_prefix}-master, {cluster_prefix}-node01, {cluster_prefix}-node02,
# and you can override this hostname in the "instances" section if you want.
defaults:
   cluster_prefix: cluster
   memory_size: 512
   number_cpus: 1
   vm_box: "ubuntu/trusty64"

#
# Notice that instances do not have a __default__ ip_address,
#   so you must specify at least ip_address: in the array of instances
instances:
  - ip_address: "10.212.10.100"
    memory_size: 513
#    hostname: master
  - ip_address: "10.212.10.101"
#    hostname: util
  - ip_address: "10.212.10.102"
#    hostname: disk01
    extra_disks:
      - file_name: 'extradisk1'
        size_in_mb:  '4096'
    synced_folders:
      - src: test
        dest: /tmp/test
      - src: www
        dest: /var/www/html
        options:
          :create: true
          :owner:  root
